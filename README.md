# New America Open COVID Project List
[![CC BY 4.0][cc-by-shield]][cc-by]

[New America](https://www.newamerica.org/) is maintaining a running list of all government open source projects responding to the novel Coronavirus.

Governments across the globe are responding to the COVID-19 pandemic by creating critical resources for their people. Many of these governments are providing their work as open source repositories, and other governments have used that work as a starting point for their response efforts. However, the discovery of these projects is difficult – open source repositories are being shared via closed channels like Slack groups or email lists, or through social networks like Twitter. Our research into open source software for government use has shown that discovery of existing OSS tools is one of the larger barriers to using more OSS in the government context.

To facilitate in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are managing this centralized resource hub where all of these projects will be catalogued for governments in need to discover. This is a joint project between the Digital Impact and Governance Initiative (DIGI) and Public Interest Technology (PIT) teams at New America.

| Open Opportunities platform                                                      | Open Opportunities is a United States government program that is creating a network of federal employees working together to build a more effective, efficient, responsive government by sharing skills and collaborating on projects that support the mission of an agency or the government as a whole. Here’s how Open Opportunities works: You come up with a great idea that would help your workplace, but you and your coworkers don’t have the skills to execute it. Rather than bringing in a contractor, you can post your project idea to Open Opportunities, where other people within your organization can see it and then work on it, if they’d like. | Resource matching       | Web             | General Services Administration                                       | USA                    | https://github.com/openopps/openopps-platform                   |                                                                                                   |                                     | https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openopps-platform                              | CC0                      | Yes                | Yes            |
